It's a code for mobile game and you are playing as the moon, trying to deffend the Earth. 
This was one of my first games, so the code and the techniques are pretty pour, but i am still very glad i was working on this project.
I have learned a lot, because of this game and maybe in the futere i will continue working on it.
 
Bullet Script and the Weapon script
Are used by Enemy2, because it is a ranged spaceship.

Earth Script 
Is attached to the Earth prefab, this is the main object that you are trying to protect.

Enemy,Enemy2 and Enemy3 
These are the scripts for the three enemies in the game, they are different and similar in the same time.

Spawner, Spawner2 and Spawner3 
These are the scripts that are used to spawn the three different enemies. I couldn't use an array to spawn them because every one of these units spawn from a different spot in the game.
