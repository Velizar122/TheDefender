It's a scripts for mobile game and you are playing as the moon, trying to deffend the Earth. 
This was one of my first games, so the code and the techniques are pretty pour, but i am still very glad i was working on this project.
I have learned a lot, because of this game and maybe in the future i will continue working on it.
 
Bullet Script and the Weapon script -
  Are used by Enemy2, because it is a ranged spaceship.

Earth Script - 
  Is attached to the Earth prefab, this is the main object that you are trying to protect.

Enemy,Enemy2 and Enemy3 -
  These are the scripts for the three enemies in the game, they are different and similar in the same time.

Spawner, Spawner2 and Spawner3 -
  These are the scripts that are used to spawn the three different enemies. I couldn't use an array to spawn them because every one of these units spawn from a 
different spot in the game.

WeaponScriptTurret -
  Is not working yet, this is my first idea for defense exept the moon(Player)

Scored,Scored2 and Scored3 -
  They are used to store how many ships are destroyed and to be able to use them, as a currency to buy upgrades.
  I could have made one script for all of them, but as i saied it was one of my first games.

The PlayerMovement
Is attached to the moon and it is used to move it around the Earth and to destroy enemy ships when they collide.

The other scripts are used for the UI in the game.
